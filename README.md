# 4-bit Binary Adder-Subtractor and ALU Design

This project focuses on designing two components: a 4-bit binary adder-subtractor and a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into two main directories:
1. **add_sub_4_bit:** Contains the implementation of the 4-bit binary adder-subtractor. The solution is in the `add_sub_4_bit.v` file, along with any supporting Verilog modules and testbench files.
2. **alu_4_bit:** Contains the implementation of the 4-bit ALU. The solution is in the `alu_4_bit.v` file, along with additional supporting Verilog modules and testbench files.

## Implementation Details
- **Adder-Subtractor:** The 4-bit binary adder-subtractor is designed to perform addition and subtraction operations using a compact logic design.
- **ALU:** The 4-bit ALU supports a range of logical and arithmetic operations. It uses modular Verilog components for clarity and scalability.

## Testing
Testbenches are provided for both the adder-subtractor and ALU, allowing for thorough simulation and validation of the designs. The testbenches ensure correct functionality for all operations and edge cases.

The project structure is clean and modular, making it easy to integrate, test, and expand.
